# Nasa Rover Exploration
This is a project to solve a programming logic challenge

## Setting up

Ruby version: 3.1.2

## Instructions
The main file of this project is the `app.rb` which is the one that must be called to execute the solution for the challenge.

This `app.rb` file will read the `input.txt` file which the content will be used as arguments following the rules of the challenge.

If you want to test the solution with other values just change the content of the input file.
